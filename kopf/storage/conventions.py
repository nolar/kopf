"""
Some reusable implementation details regarding naming in K8s.

This module implements conventions for annotations & labels with restrictions.
They are used to identify operator's own keys consistently during the run,
keep backward- & forward-compatibility of naming schemas across the versions,
and to detect cross-operator keys to prevent ping-pong effects (if Kopf-based).

This is mostly important for storages in the shared spaces, such as annotations
or labels of a resource being handled: to distinguish operator-related and
unrelated keys (e.g. manually added annotations/labels).

For some fields, such as annotations and labels, K8s puts extra restrictions
on the alphabet used and on lengths of the names, name parts, and values.
All such restrictions are implemented here in combination with the conventions.

Terminology (to be on the same page; `aligned with K8s's documentation`__):

__ https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set

* **prefix** is a fqdn-like optional part (e.g. `kopf.zalando.org/`);
* **name** is the main part of an annotation/label (e.g. `kopf-managed`);
* **key** (a dictionary key, a full key) is the **prefix** plus the **name**,
  possibly suffixed, infixed (named-prefixed), fully or partially hashed
  (e.g. `example.com/kopf-managed` or `kopf.zalando.org/handler1.subhandlerA`),
  but used as a dictionary key for the annotations (hence the name).

Note: there are also progress storages' **record keys**, which are not related
to the annotations/labels keys of this convention: they correspond to the names:
in most cases, they will be used as the annotation names with special symbols
replaced; in some cases, they will be cut and hash-suffixed.

class CollisionEvadingConvention:
    """
    A helper mixin to evade collisions in annotations propagated down by K8s.

    For some resources, such as ReplicaSets owned by Deployments,
    the annotations are implicitly propagated by Kubernetes
    from the owning resources down to the owned resources.

    As a result, if both resources are served by Kopf-based operators with
    the same or default identity, the owner's annotations overwrite those
    of the resource, which causes all kinds of chaos when e.g. the diff-base
    mismatches the resource's schema or the handlers' progress is miscalculated.

    To evade this, Kopf adds special marks to all annotations of all resources
    known to be overwritten by Kubernetes -- in order to preserve the state
    regardless of whether the parent's annotations are already propagated:
    this can happen much later when the owning resource is started to be served
    hours, days, months after the owned resource has stored its state.

    The only known case at the moment is caused by this behaviour in Kubernetes:

    * https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.20.2/pkg/controller/deployment/util/deployment_util.go#L230-L234
    * https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.20.2/pkg/controller/deployment/util/deployment_util.go#L310-L341

    We assume this does not happen to other resources unless proven otherwise.

class StorageKeyFormingConvention(CollisionEvadingConvention):
    """
    A helper mixin to manage annotations/labels naming as per K8s restrictions.

    Used both in the diff-base storages and the progress storages where
    applicable. It provides a few optional methods to manage annotation
    prefixes, keys, and names (in this context, a name is a prefix + a key).
    Specifically, the annotations keys are split to V1 & V2 (would be V3, etc).

    **V1** keys were implemented overly restrictive: the length of 63 chars
    was applied to the whole annotation key, including the prefix.

    This caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of useful information: e.g.
    ``lengthy-operator-name-to-hit-63-chars.example.com/update-OJOYLA``
    instead of
    ``lengthy-operator-name-to-hit-63-chars.example.com/update.sub1``.

    `K8s says`__ that only the name is max 63 chars long, while the whole key
    (i.e. including the prefix, if present) can be max 253 chars.

    __ https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set

    **V2** keys implement this new hashing approach, trying to keep as much
    information in the keys as possible. Only the really lengthy keys
    will be cut the same way as V1 keys.

    If the prefix is longer than 189 chars (253-63-1), the full key could
    be longer than the limit of 253 chars -- e.g. with lengthy handler ids,
    more often for field-handlers or sub-handlers. In that case,
    the annotation keys are not shortened, and the patching would fail.

    It is the developer's responsibility to choose the prefix short enough
    to fit into K8s's restrictions. However, a warning is issued on storage
    creation, so that the strict-mode operators could convert the warning
    into an exception, thus failing the operator startup.

    For smoother upgrades of operators from V1 to V2, and for safer rollbacks
    from V2 to V1, both versions of keys are stored in annotations.
    At some point in time, the V1 keys will be read, purged, but not stored,
    thus cutting the rollback possibilities to Kopf versions with V1 keys.

    Since the annotations are purged in case of a successful handling cycle,
    this multi-versioned behaviour will most likely be unnoticed by the users,
    except when investigating the issues with persistence.

    This mode can be controlled via the storage's constructor parameter
    ``v1=True/False`` (the default is ``True`` for the time of transition).

class StorageKeyMarkingConvention:
    """
    A mixin to detect annotations of other Kopf-based operators.

    The detection of other Kopf-based operators' annotations should prevent
    "ping-pong" effects of multiple operators handling the same resources:

    (1) operator A persists its state into an object;
    (2) operator B believes it is a valid essential change and reacts;
    (3) operator B persists its updated state (diff-base), which contains
        the state of the operator A as the essential payload;
    (4) operator A believes the new change is a valid essential change;
    (âˆž) and so it continues forever (the annotations sizes can explode fast).

    To detect the annotations as belonging to Kopf-based operators, the storages
    inject a marker into the annotation names, and later detect these markers.

    As an extra safety measure, all names of the whole `domain.tld/` prefix,
    both V1 & V2, are detected as marked if there is at least one marked V2 name
    under that prefix -- assuming that the prefix is for a Kopf-based operator.
    For non-prefixed storages, the V1 names are detected by their V2
    counterparts with some additional treatment (marker & hashes removed).

    The marker and the marking are not configurable to prevent turning them off,
    except as by writing self-made storages. In that case, all ping-pong issues
    are considered as intended and handled by the storage/operator developers.

    This logic is already included into all Kopf-provided storages, both with
    and without annotations, so there is no need to explicitly configure it.
    The only case where this class can be of direct use, is when custom storages
    are implemented, but other operators' annotations still have to be cleaned.
