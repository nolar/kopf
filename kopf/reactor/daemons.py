"""
Daemons are background tasks accompanying the individual resource objects.

Every ``@kopf.daemon`` and ``@kopf.timer`` handler produces a separate
asyncio task to either directly execute the daemon, or to trigger one-shot
handlers by schedule. The wrapping tasks are always async; the sync functions
are called in thread executors as part of a regular handler invocation.

These tasks are remembered in the per-resources *memories* (arbitrary data
containers) through the life-cycle of the operator.

Since the operators are event-driven conceptually, there are no background tasks
running for every individual resources normally (i.e. without the daemons),
so there are no connectors between the operator's root tasks and the daemons,
so there is no way to stop/kill/cancel the daemons when the operator exits.

For this, there is an artificial root task spawned to kill all the daemons
when the operator exits, and all root tasks are gracefully/forcedly terminated.
Otherwise, all the daemons would be considered as "hung" tasks and will be
force-killed after some timeout -- which can be avoided, since we are aware
of the daemons, and they are not actually "hung".

    Terminate all daemons of an individual resource (gracefully and by force).

    All daemons are terminated in parallel to speed up the termination
    (especially taking into account that some daemons can take time to finish).

    The daemons are asked to terminate as soon as the object is marked
    for deletion. It can take some time until the deletion handlers also
    finish their work. The object is not physically deleted until all
    the daemons are terminated (by putting a finalizer on it).

    **Notes on this non-trivial implementation:**

    There is a same-purpose function `stop_daemon`, which works fully in-memory.
    That method is used when killing the daemons on operator exit.
    This method is used when the resource is deleted.

    The difference is that in this method (termination with delays and patches),
    other on-deletion handlers can be happening at the same time as the daemons
    are being terminated (it can take time due to backoffs and timeouts).
    In the end, the finalizer should be removed only once all deletion handlers
    have succeeded and all daemons are terminated -- not earlier than that.
    None of this (handlers and finalizers) is needed for the operator exiting.

    To know "when" the next check of daemons should be performed:

    * EITHER the operator should block this resource's processing and wait until
      the daemons are terminated -- thus leaking daemon's abstractions and logic
      and tools (e.g. aiojobs scheduler) to the upper level of processing;

    * OR the daemons termination should mimic the change-detection handlers
      and simulate the delays with multiple handling cycles -- in order to
      re-check the daemon's status regularly until they are done.

    Both of this approaches have the same complexity. But the latter one
    keep the logic isolated into the daemons module/routines (a bit cleaner).

    Hence, these duplicating methods of termination for different cases
    (as by their surrounding circumstances: deletion handlers and finalizers).
