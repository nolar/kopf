"""
Supporting tasks for startup/cleanup and to keep the operator functional.

Consumes a credentials vault, and monitors that it has enough credentials.
When the credentials are invalidated (i.e. excluded), run the re-authentication
activity and populates with the new credentials (fully or partially).

The process is intentionally split into multiple packages:

* Authenticating background task (this module) is a part of the reactor,
  as it will not be able to run without up-to-date credentials,
  and since it initiates the reactor's activities and invokes the handlers.
* Vault are the data structures used mostly in the API clients wrappers
  (which are the low-level modules, so they cannot import the credentials
  from the high-level modules such as the reactor/engines).
* Specific authentication methods, such as the authentication piggybacking,
  belong to neither the reactor, nor the engines, nor the client wrappers.
