"""
Watching and streaming watch-events.

Kubernetes client's watching streams are synchronous. To make them asynchronous,
we put them into a `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`,
and yield from there asynchronously.

However, async/await coroutines misbehave with `StopIteration` exceptions
raised by the `next` method: see `PEP-479`_.

As a workaround, we replace `StopIteration` with our custom `StopStreaming`
inherited from `RuntimeError` (as suggested by `PEP-479`_),
and re-implement the generators to make them async.

All of this is a workaround for the standard Kubernetes client's limitations.
They would not be needed if the client library were natively asynchronous.

    Block the execution until un-paused; signal when it is active again.

    This prevents both watching and listing while the operator is paused,
    until it is off. Specifically, the watch-stream closes its connection
    once paused, so the while-true & for-event-in-stream cycles exit,
    and the streaming coroutine is started again by `infinite_stream()`
    (the watcher timeout is swallowed by the pause time).

    Returns a future (or a task) that is set (or finished) when paused again.

    A stop-future is a client-specific way of terminating the streaming HTTPS
    connections when paused again. The low-level streaming API call attaches
    its `response.close()` to the future's "done" callback,
    so that the stream is closed once the operator is paused.

    Note: this routine belongs to watching and does not belong to peering.
    The pause can be managed in any other ways: as an imaginary edge case,
    imagine a operator with UI with a "pause" button that pauses the operator.
