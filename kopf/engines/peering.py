"""
Peer monitoring: knowing which other operators do run, and exchanging the basic signals with them.

The main use-case is to suppress all deployed operators when a developer starts a dev-/debug-mode
operator for the same cluster on their workstation -- to avoid any double-processing.

See also: `kopf freeze` & `kopf resume` CLI commands for the same purpose.

WARNING: There are **NO** per-object locks between the operators, so only one operator
should be functional for the cluster, i.e. only one with the highest priority running.
If the operator sees the violations of this constraint, it will print the warnings
pointing to another same-priority operator, but will continue to function.

The "signals" exchanged are only the keep-alive notifications from the operator being alive,
and detection of other operators hard termination (by timeout rather than by clear exit).

The peers monitoring covers both the in-cluster operators running,
and the dev-mode operators running in the dev workstations.

For this, special CRDs ``kind: ClusterKopfPeering`` & ``kind: KopfPeering``
should be registered in the cluster, and their ``status`` field is used
by all the operators to sync their keep-alive info.

The namespace-bound operators (e.g. `--namespace=`) report their individual
namespaces are part of the payload, can see all other cluster and namespaced
operators (even from the different namespaces), and behave accordingly.

The CRD is not applied automatically, so you have to deploy it yourself explicitly.
To disable the peers monitoring, use the `--standalone` CLI option.
