"""
Detection of the event causes, based on the resource state.

The low-level watch-events are highly limited in information on what
caused them, and they only notify that the object was changed somehow:

* ``ADDED`` for the newly created objects (or for the first-time listing).
* ``MODIFIED`` for the changes of any field, be that metadata, spec, or status.
* ``DELETED`` for the actual deletion of the object post-factum.

The conversion of low-level *events* to high level *causes* is done by
checking the object's state and comparing it to the saved last-seen state.

This allows to track which specific fields were changed, and if are those
changes are important enough to call the handlers: e.g. the ``status`` changes
are ignored, so as some selected system fields of the ``metadata``.

For deletion, the cause is detected when the object is just marked for deletion,
not when it is actually deleted (as the events notify): so that the handlers
could execute on the yet-existing object (and its children, if created).

    Base non-specific cause as used in the framework's reactor in most cases.

    IMPORTANT! Indices overwrite any other kwargs, even the existing ones.

    Why so? Here is why: for forwards & backwards compatibility.
    If an handler uses an index named "children", and Kopf introduces
    a new kwarg "children", the handler's code could break on the upgrade.
    To prevent this, Kopf overwrites the framework's kwarg "children"
    with the operator's index "children" and lets the developers rename it
    when (and if) they want the new kwarg.

    Naming the new indices the same as the known/existing kwargs
    harms only the developers who do so, so this is considered safe.
