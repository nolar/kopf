"""
Routines to apply effects accumulated during the reaction cycle.

Applying the effects is the last step in the reacting cycle:

* :mod:`queueing` streams the events to per-object processing tasks,
* :mod:`causation` detects what has happened based on the received events,
* :mod:`handling` decides how to react, and invokes the handlers,
* :mod:`effects` applies the effects accumulated during the handling.

The effects are accumulated both from the framework and from the operator's
handlers, and are generally of these three intermixed kinds:

* Patching the object with all the results & states persisted.
* Sleeping for the duration of known absence of activity (or until interrupted).
* Touching the object to trigger the next reaction cycle.

It is used from in :mod:`processing`, :mod:`actitivies`, and :mod:`daemons` --
all the modules, of which the reactor's core consists.
