"""
An internal in-memory storage of structured records about resource objects.

Each object gets at most one record in the inventory of an operator's memories.
The information is stored strictly in-memory and is not persistent.
On the operator restart, all the memories are lost.
The information is not exposed to the operator developers (except for memos).

It is used internally to track allocated system resources for each Kubernetes
object, even if that object does not show up in the event streams for long time.

In the future, additional never-ending tasks can be running to maintain
the operator's memories and inventory and garbage-collect all outdated records.

The inventory memories are data structures, but they are a part of the reactor
because they store specialised data structures of specialised reactor modules
(e.g. daemons, admission, indexing, etc). For cohesion, these data structures
must be kept together with their owning modules rather than mirrored in structs.

    A container of all memos about every existing resource in a single operator.

    Distinct operator tasks have their own memory containers, which
    do not overlap. This solves the problem if storing the per-resource
    entries in the global or context variables.

    The memos can store anything the resource handlers need to persist within
    a single process/operator lifetime, but not persisted on the resource.
    For example, the runtime system resources: flags, threads, tasks, etc.
    Or the scalar values, which have meaning only for this operator process.

    The container is relatively async-safe: one individual resource is always
    handled sequentially, never in parallel with itself (different resources
    are handled in parallel through), so the same key will not be added/deleted
    in the background during the operation, so the locking is not needed.
