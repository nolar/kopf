"""
Conversion of low-level events to high-level causes, and handling them.

These functions are invoked from `kopf._core.reactor.processing`,
which are the actual event loop of the operator process.

The conversion of the low-level events to the high-level causes is done by
checking the object's state and comparing it to the preserved last-seen state.

The framework itself makes the necessary changes to the object, -- such as the
finalizers attachment, last-seen state updates, and handler status tracking, --
thus provoking the low-level watch-events and additional queueing calls.
But these internal changes are filtered out from the cause detection
and therefore do not trigger the user-defined handlers.
