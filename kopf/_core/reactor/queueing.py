"""
Kubernetes watching/streaming and the per-object queueing system.

The framework can handle multiple resources at once.
Every custom resource type is "watched" (as in ``kubectl get --watch``)
in a separate asyncio task in the never-ending loop.

The events for this resource type (of all its objects) are then pushed
to the per-object queues, which are created and destroyed dynamically.
The per-object queues are created on demand.

Every object is identified by its uid, and is handled sequentially:
i.e. the low-level events are processed in the order of their arrival.
Other objects are handled in parallel in their own sequential tasks.

To prevent the memory leaks over the long run, the queues and the workers
of each object are destroyed if no new events arrive for some time.
The destruction delay (usually a few seconds, maybe minutes) is needed
to prevent the often queue/worker destruction and re-creation
in case the events are for any reason delayed by Kubernetes.

The conversion of the low-level watch-events to the high-level causes
is done in the `kopf._core.reactor.processing` routines.

    The keys are only persistent during a lifetime of a single process.
    They can be safely changed across different versions.

    A single worker for a single resource object, each running in its own task.

    An object worker consumes the events from the object-dedicated queue filled
    by the watcher of the whole resource kind (i.e. of all objects of that kind)
    and invokes the processor (which implies handlers) for that specific object.

    The processor is an internal coroutine of the framework, not of the user.
    There are several types of processors involved:

    - For operator peering: monitors the peers and suspends/resumes operations.
    - For cluster observation: spawns new watchers for new CRDs/namespaces.
    - For resource handling: detects changes and calls the user-side handlers.

    The worker is time-limited: it exits as soon as all the object's events
    have been processed and there are no new events for some time if idling
    (a few seconds -- to prevent exiting and recreating the workers too often).
    The watcher will spawn a new worker when (and if) new events arrive.
