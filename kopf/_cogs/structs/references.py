    Check if the specific namespace matches a namespace specification.

    Each individual namespace pattern is a string that follows some syntax:

    * the pattern consists of comma-separated parts (spaces are ignored);
    * each part is either an inclusive or an exclusive (negating) glob;
    * each glob can have ``*`` and ``?`` placeholders for any or one symbols;
    * the exclusive globs start with ``!``;
    * if the the first glob is exclusive, then a preceding catch-all is implied.

    A check of whether a namespace matches the individual pattern, is done by
    iterating the pattern's globs left-to-right: the exclusive patterns exclude
    it from the match; the first inclusive pattern does the initial match, while
    the following inclusive patterns only re-match it if it was excluded before;
    i.e., they do not do the full initial match.

    For example, the pattern ``"myapp-*, !*-pr-*, *pr-123"``
    will match ``myapp-test``, ``myapp-live``, even ``myapp-pr-123``,
    but not ``myapp-pr-456`` and certainly not ``otherapp-pr-123``.
    The latter one, despite it matches the last glob, is not included
    because it was not matched by the initial pattern.

    On the other hand, the pattern ``"!*-pr-*, *pr-123"``
    (equivalent to ``"*, !*-pr-*, *pr-123"``) will match ``myapp-test``,
    ``myapp-live``, ``myapp-pr-123``, ``anyapp-anything``,
    and even ``otherapp-pr-123`` -- though not ``myapp-pr-456``.
    Unlike in the first example, the otherapp's namespace was included initially
    by the first glob (the implied ``*``), and therefore could be re-matched
    by the last glob ``*pr-123`` after being excluded by ``!*-pr-*``.

    While these are theoretical capabilities of this pattern-matching algorithm,
    it is not expected that they will be abused too much. The main intention is
    to have simple one-glob patterns (either inclusive or exclusive),
    only rarely followed by a single negation.
