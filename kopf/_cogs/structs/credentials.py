"""
Authentication-related structures.

Kopf handles some rudimentary authentication directly, and exposes the ways
to implement custom authentication methods (via `on.login` handlers).

For that, a minimally sufficient data structure is introduced -- both
to bring all the credentials together in a structured and type-annotated way,
and to receive them from the operators' login-handlers with custom auth methods.

The "rudimentary" is defined as the information passed to the HTTP protocol
and TCP/SSL connection only, i.e. everything usable in a generic HTTP client,
and nothing more than that:

* TCP server host & port.
* SSL verification/ignorance flag.
* SSL certificate authority.
* SSL client certificate and its private key.
* HTTP ``Authorization: Basic username:password``.
* HTTP ``Authorization: Bearer token`` (or other schemes: Bearer, Digest, etc).
* URL's default namespace for the cases when this is implied.

    :func:`authentication` and :mod:`piggybacking`.
