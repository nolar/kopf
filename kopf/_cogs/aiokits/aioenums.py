    A boolean flag indicating that the daemon should stop and exit.

    Every daemon gets a ``stopped`` kwarg, which is an event-like object.
    The stopped flag is raised in two cases:

    * The corresponding k8s object is deleted, so the daemon should stop.
    * The whole operator is stopping, so all the daemons should stop too.

    The stopped flag is a graceful way of a daemon termination.
    If the daemons do not react to their stoppers and continue running,
    their tasks are cancelled by raising a `asyncio.CancelledError`.

    .. warning::
        In case of synchronous handlers, which are executed in the threads,
        this can lead to the OS resource leakage:
        there is no way to kill a thread in Python, so it will continue running
        forever or until failed (e.g. on an API call for an absent resource).
        The orphan threads will block the operator's process from exiting,
        thus affecting the speed of restarts.

    An artificial future-like promise for ``await stopped.wait(...)``.

    This is a low-level "clean hack" to simplify the publicly faced types.
    As a trade-off, the complexity moves to the implementation side.

    The only goal is to accept one and only one type for the ``stopped`` kwarg
    in ``@kopf.daemon()`` handlers (protocol :class:`callbacks.DaemonFn`)
    regardless of whether they are sync or async, but still usable for both.

    For this, the kwarg is announced with the base type :class:`DaemonStopped`,
    not as a union of sync or async, or any other double-typed approach.

    The challenge is to support ``stopped.wait()`` in both sync & async modes:

    * sync: ``stopped.wait(float) -> bool``.
    * async: ``await stopped.wait(float) -> bool``.

    The sync case is the primary case as there are no alternatives to it.
    The async case is secondary because such use is discouraged (but supported);
    it is recommended to rely on regular task cancellations in async daemons.

    To solve it, instead of returning a ``bool``, a ``bool``-evaluable object
    is returned --- the checker itself. This solves the primary (sync) use-case:
    just sleep for the requested duration and return bool-evaluable self.

    To follow the established signatures of the primary (sync) use-case,
    the secondary (async) use-case also returns an instance of the checker:
    but not "self"! Instead, it creates a new time-limited & awaitable checker
    for every call to ``stopped.wait(n)``, limiting its life by ``n`` seconds.

    Extra checker instances add some tiny memory overhead, but this is fine
    since the use-case is discouraged and there is a better native alternative.

    Then, going back through the class hierarchy, all classes are made awaitable
    so that this functionality becomes exposed via the declared base class.
    But all checkers except the time-limited one prohibit waiting for them.
