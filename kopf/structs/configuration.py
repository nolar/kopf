"""
All configuration flags, options, settings to fine-tune an operator.

All settings are grouped semantically just for convenience
(instead of a flat mega-object with all the values in it).

The individual groups or settings can eventually be moved or regrouped within
the root object, while keeping the legacy names for backward compatibility.

.. note::

    There is a discussion on usage of such words as "configuration",
    "preferences", "settings", "options", "properties" in the internet:

    * https://stackoverflow.com/q/2074384/857383
    * https://qr.ae/pNvt40
    * etc.

    In this framework, they are called *"settings"* (plural).
    Combined, they form a *"configuration"* (singular).

    Some of the settings are flags, some are scalars, some are optional,
    some are not (but all of them have reasonable defaults).

    Regardless of the exact class and module names, all of these terms can be
    used interchangeably -- but so that it is understandable what is meant.

    to give control back to the event loop and their coroutines. However,
    the daemons/timers can do extra `await` calls (even zero-time) before
    actually exiting, which prematurely returns the control flow back
    to the daemon-stopper coroutine.

    This configuration value is a maximum amount of zero-time `await` statements
    that can happen before exiting: both in the daemon and in the framework.

    It the daemons/timers coroutines exit earlier, extra cycles are not used.
