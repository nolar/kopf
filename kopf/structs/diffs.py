    Calculate the diff between two dicts.

    Yields the tuple of form ``(op, path, old, new)``,

    ``path`` is a tuple with the field names (empty tuple means root),

    List values are treated as a whole, and not recursed into.
    Therefore, an addition/removal of a list item is considered
    as a change of the whole value.
