.. todo:: Fit this page into the walk-through sample story?

Kopf supports asynchronous handler functions::

    import asyncio
    import kopf

    @kopf.on.create('kopfexamples')
    async def create_fn(spec, **_):
        await asyncio.sleep(1.0)

Async functions have an additional benefit over the non-async ones
to make the full stack trace available when exceptions occur
or IDE breakpoints are used since the async functions are executed
directly inside of Kopf's event loop in the main thread.

Regular synchronous handlers, despite supported for convenience,
are executed in parallel threads (via the default executor of the loop),
and can only see the stack traces up to the thread entry point.

.. warning::
    As with any async coroutines, it is the developer's responsibility
    to make sure that all the internal function calls are either
    ``await``\s of other async coroutines (e.g. ``await asyncio.sleep()``),
    or the regular non-blocking functions calls.

    Calling a synchronous function (e.g. HTTP API calls or ``time.sleep()``)
    inside of an asynchronous function will block the whole operator process
    until the synchronous call if finished, i.e. even other resources
    processed in parallel, and the Kubernetes event-watching/-queueing cycles.

    This can come unnoticed in the development environment
    with only a few resources and no external timeouts,
    but can hit hard in the production environments with high load.
