async def test_consistent_awakening(registry, settings, resource, k8s_mocked, mocker):
    """
    A special case to ensure that "now" is consistent during the handling.

    Previously, "now" of `handler.awakened` and "now" of `state.delay` were
    different (maybe for less than 1 ms). If the scheduled awakening time was
    unlucky to be between these two points in time, the operator stopped
    reacting on this object until any other events or changes arrive.

    Implementation-wise, the operator neither selected the handlers (because
    it was "1ms too early", as per `handler.awakened`),
    nor did it sleep (because it was "1ms too late", as per `state.delay`),
    nor did it produce even a dummy patch (because zero-sleep meant "no sleep").

    After the fix, zero-sleep produces a dummy patch to trigger the reaction
    cycle after the sleep is over (as if it was an actual zero-time sleep).

    In the test, the time granularity is intentionally that low -- 1 Âµs.
    The time is anyway frozen and does not progress unless explicitly ticked.
